#Deployment

To deploy the application, first ensure all environment variables are defined in the `.env` file. Then run `deploy.sh`, which builds the Docker image, pushes it to the container registry, and updates the Kubernetes deployment. Deployment typically completes within 5â€“10 minutes.

This process should only be run by users with deploy access rights, as it may overwrite the currently running production instance.
